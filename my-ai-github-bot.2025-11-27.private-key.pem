#                       🔐 PRIVATE KEY REQUIRED
# =======================================================================
# This file is intentionally left without a private key.
#
# To use this application, you must supply **your own valid RSA private key**.
# Paste your key in this file ONLY on your local machine and NEVER commit,
# upload, or share that key in any public or private repository.
#
# IMPORTANT:
#   • Do NOT store real private keys in Git, GitHub, GitLab, or any VCS.
#   • Do NOT send your private key to anyone or any service that you do not trust.
#   • Do NOT use placeholder or example keys for production environments.
#
# SECURITY GUIDELINES:
#   • Generate your own key using a trusted tool (e.g., ssh-keygen, openssl).
#   • Keep private keys secure and accessible only to authorized users.
#   • Rotate your keys regularly and immediately revoke any key that is exposed.
#   • Ensure file permissions are correctly set (e.g., chmod 600 on UNIX systems).
#
# HOW TO USE:
#   1. Generate a new RSA private key if you do not already have one.
#   2. Paste ONLY your private key content between the BEGIN/END sections below.
#   3. Do not modify the header/footer lines of your key.
#   4. Keep this file OUT of version control at all times.
#
# Failure to follow these instructions may result in severe security risks,
# including unauthorized access to systems, data breaches, and service compromise.
#
# =======================================================================
# Insert your RSA private key between the lines below:
# =======================================================================

-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
# Your private key should be pasted here.
# This placeholder will be ignored by the application if not replaced.
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
